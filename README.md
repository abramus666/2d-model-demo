[Run demo](https://abramus666.github.io/2d-model-demo/)

Demo showing an animated 2D model of a walking girl. There are two versions, both implemented in WebGL:
- The first version uses basic texturing with no lighting.
- The second version uses Blinn-Phong lighting with a normal map for 3D-like effect. Moving mouse cursor (or touching screen on mobile devices) changes the light position. Mouse wheel adjusts gamma correction.
