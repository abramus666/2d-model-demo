Demo showing an animated 2D model of a walking girl. The model has been created using [this editor](https://github.com/abramus666/2d-model-editor).

There are two versions of the demo, both implemented in WebGL:
- The first version uses basic texturing with no lighting.
- The second version uses Blinn-Phong lighting with a normal map for 3D-like effect. Moving mouse cursor (or touching screen on mobile devices) changes the light position. Mouse wheel adjusts gamma correction.
